          INSTALL of  APRX 2


Instructions for how to build Debian apt packages are provided
at the end of this file


A rough-cut version of the installation instructions

  0) Prerequisites:
      Does not need anything beside standard libc!
      (In particular the Linux version does not need
       libax25 / libax25-dev !)

  1) Start with  ./configure  --parameters
     For a small memory system without writable /tmp
     you have to use  --with-embedded   option.

  2) Cleanliness is good start:

         $ make clean

  3) Compile the thing:

         $ make

  4) There is automatic "install" as:

         # make install

      with several presumptions about directories fixed
      into the Makefile (possibly some adjustments are
      required, depending upon your environment.)

  5) Edit the configuration file to match your system:

        # $EDITOR /etc/aprx.conf

     See the  aprx(8) man-page for more info (man 8 aprx)

  6) Program startup scripts ("init-scripts") exist for a
     couple system environments, others may need manual
     adapting.



For Debian users wanting to compile themselves instead of using
precompiled binaries:

	# aptitude install git build-essential debhelper libssl-dev
	$ git clone https://github.com/PhirePhly/aprx.git
	$ cd aprx
	$ ./configure
	$ make make-deb
	# dpkg -i ../aprx_....deb
